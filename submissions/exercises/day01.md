#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>

    Answer:     Shopee and Lazada have both interfaces that are easily navigated by their users. However, Shopeeâ€™s homepage exhibits a more organized, relaxed, and                 uniform elements that offers all the necessary services that the user needs. In contrary with this, Lazadaâ€™s homepage also offers the main buttons                  for navigation for its services, but this seems to become cluttered because the user will be instantly bombarded LazFlash Deals, instead of                         focusing on Shopping Categories just like Shopee. 

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>

    Answer:     The abrupt introduction of LazFlash Deals and rapidly displaying promotions and products in the Homepage made it cluttered and exhausting to look                   for. New users will have a hard time to navigate and familiarize with its interface, because it is too aggressive in marketing their products and                   boosting their sales, instead of letting the users freely navigate the homepage according to their preference. 

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>

    Answer:     As I explained, Shopeeâ€™s interface looked more organized and relaxed for users that just opened their app. The Homepage strategically arranged the                  features of Shopee, starting from the search bar in the top, the carousel image slider for promotions, the pane for categories and services, some                   promotions and small section of Shopee Live, and the menu in the bottom of the app. Then, huge promotions of products and Flash Sales will be                       displayed after one scroll to the bottom, which offers the users when to interact with the items in sale, unlike Lazada that displays these                         contents in the first page of their homepage. All of this Shopeeâ€™s planning and organization of elements made their apps become easily navigable                    and recognizable for both new and existing users. 

                

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>

    Answer:     Yes, both Shopee and Lazada remained faithful to their branding when it comes to their website and application design. All of the elements,                         starting from colors, icons, promotions, advertisements, layout, navigation, animations, and almost all aspects are visually appealing and                          consistent across their platforms. 
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>

    Answer:     All of their platforms across different devices seems to be responsive, which offers users the full functionality and efficient utilization of                      their applications. The mobile apps are well-suited for navigation in small screens like cellphones and tablets. I also checked their websites in a                 browser, and I am surprised that both Shopee and Lazada donâ€™t have responsive web layouts when the windows are resized. The elements are just                       forced to occupy the cramped small space, while the others are not displayed properly and exceeds the bounds of the window. 
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>

    Answer:     Shopeeâ€™s website also wins this comparison, because their website also possesses vital characteristics in UI/UX principles, organization and                        relaxed introduction of their services. Users will also gain a sense of familiarity because the layout matches with the mobile app version, and                     this is optimized for larger screens like viewing the website in a browser.
